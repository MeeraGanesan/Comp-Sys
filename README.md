Note: Code is kept private, can show on a need-to-know basis.

Implemented to following projects:
- Simulation of CPU/memory resource optimized hardware memory cache with optimal hit ratio and versatile eviction
algorithms (C/Linux)
 - Implemented a dynamic memory allocator with efficient memory utilisation (consisting of malloc, free, realloc, and calloc)
(C/Linux)
- Developed a custom Linux shell that supports job control and I/O redirection (C/Linux)
- Implemented a HTTP proxy that handles scalable concurrent connections with optimized Caching (C/Linux)
